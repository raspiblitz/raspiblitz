# Shopping List: Switzerland

*__NOTICE: This shopping list had just basic testing of components__ - [please report](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/issues/691) if you have bad experiences or ideas for better cheaper updates.*

The new shopping list comes in three different packages: Minimal, Standard & Maximal:

## Package: Standard (around 210 CHF)

*The "Standard Package" is most tested and recommended if you can effort it. It aims to give you the best economic value to run all the RaspiBlitz features at a good performance and even allows you to self-validate your blockchain in under 3 days.* 

* RaspberryPi 4 2GB: [pi-shop.ch](https://www.pi-shop.ch/raspberry-pi-4-model-b-2gb)
* ShimFan Cooling: [pi-shop.ch](https://www.pi-shop.ch/fan-shim-for-raspberry-pi) (order later if sold out)
* Power USBC: [pi-shop.ch](https://www.pi-shop.ch/raspberry-pi-15w-power-supply-eu-schwarz)
* RaspberryPi-Case: [pi-shop.ch](https://www.pi-shop.ch/rainbow-pibow-coupe-4-raspberry-pi-4-only)
* 1TB SSD: [pi-shop.ch](https://www.pi-shop.ch/seagate-expansion-portable-2-5-1tb) or [Brack.ch](https://www.brack.ch/toshiba-externe-festplatte-canvio-basics-1-tb-813514)
* SSD-Case: (not needed in case of [pi-shop.ch](https://www.pi-shop.ch/seagate-expansion-portable-2-5-1tb) solution)
* Micro SD-Card 32GB: [pi-shop.ch](https://www.pi-shop.ch/32gb-microsd-karte-class10-noobs-fuer-raspberry-pi-bereits-installiert)
* LCD-Display: [pi-shop.ch](https://www.pi-shop.ch/3-5inch-rpi-lcd-b-ic-test-board)

## Package: Minimal (around 180 CHF)

*The minimal package aims for the cheapest price and allows you to use old hardware. It will always be possible to run all the basic features of a Bitcoin- & Lightning-Fullnode, but the system might be too slow to validate the blockchain history by itself and run some resource intensive extended services. 500GB SSD are in the same price range like 1TB, therefore go with 1TB*

Basic Parts for all minimal variants:
* 1TB SSD: [pi-shop.ch](https://www.pi-shop.ch/seagate-expansion-portable-2-5-1tb) or [Brack.ch](https://www.brack.ch/toshiba-externe-festplatte-canvio-basics-1-tb-813514)
* Micro SD-Card 16GB: [pi-shop.ch](https://www.pi-shop.ch/16-gb-microsd-karte-class10-noobs-fuer-raspberry-pi-bereits-installiert)
* LCD-Display: [pi-shop.ch](https://www.pi-shop.ch/3-5inch-rpi-lcd-b-ic-test-board)

If you have already a used RaspberryPi 3 B+ you can reuse with the following parts:
* RaspBerry Pi 3: [pi-shop.ch](https://www.pi-shop.ch/raspberry-pi-3-model-b)
* Power USBC: [pi-shop.ch](https://www.pi-shop.ch/raspberry-pi-15w-power-supply-eu-schwarz)
* Heatsink-Case: [ch.ELV.com](https://ch.elv.com/joy-it-armor-gehaeuse-block-fuer-raspberry-pi-3-schutz-und-kuehlung-zugleich-250877?fs=2011683704) 

Or if you order new go with the RaspberryPi 4 1GB and the following parts:
