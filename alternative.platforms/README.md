## amd64 image

### Requirements
* amd64 Laptop, Desktop or Server connected to the internet via a LAN cable

* `OS disk`: min 32GB SSD is recommended to run the system on
    * if the computer can boot from an SDcard an Endurance type card can be used similar to the RPi setup
    * USB SSD recommendation: [Sandisk Extreme Pro USB 128 GB](https://www.amazon.co.uk/SanDisk-Extreme-Solid-State-Flash/dp/B01MU8TZRV)
    * if the laptop has an optical drive an [Optical Drive Bay Caddy / adapter](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07SHSCVC7/) can be used to change it to a second SSD instead.
* `Data disk`: a new, minimum 1TB SSD is recommended - stores data independent of the operating system
    * usually placed internally


### Download
 * raspiblitz-amd64-v1.7.2-2022-04-03
   * manually created with the [process described below](#Create-an-image-release-for-amd64) from the [`dev` branch](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/tree/dev) at [43c7384](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/tree/43c7384cb70523c57990e0c409d51cfd7b818a10)

      ```

### [Verify](#Verify-the-downloaded-image)
### Write the image to the OS disk
* On a separate computer: write the image to the USB connected OSdisk or SDcard with [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
* On the same computer: boot an Ubuntu Live from USB with which the image can be downloaded, verified and flashed on an internal or USB connected OS disk

### Start the Raspiblitz setup
* Assemble and start the computer.
* Log in with admin and open a terminal on the local desktop or log in with ssh (username `admin` password: `raspiblitz`)
* Continue the setup as described in the [main readme](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz#setup-process-detailed-documentation)

## Virtual Machine

Instructions to run a RaspiBlitz as a VM on a Linux host machine.
The process is similar if you want to run RaspiBlitz on the bare metal.

Tested with:
* Debian image in VirtualBox and linux virt-manager / [cockpit-machines](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit-machines)
* Ubuntu image in VirtualBox and linux virt-manager / [cockpit-machines](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit-machines)
* Debian image in VirtualBox https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/issues/2756#issuecomment-983532237
* TrueNAS (FreeBSD bhyve) with an Ubuntu VM: https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/issues/2104#issuecomment-917444238

### Create the base image
* Download and install the base OS on an at least 32GB drive
* Debian is the most tested and is closest to the RaspberryOS: <https://www.debian.org/distrib/>
* Ubuntu should work, but less tested
* To just experiment can load a virtualbox image from: <https://www.osboxes.org/debian/> or <https://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu>.
These not need installation, password: `osboxes.org`

### Building the Raspiblitz scripts
* Run the build script in the terminal of the guest OS (with sudo access):

    ```bash
    # download the build script
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/dev/build_sdcard.sh
    # run
    sudo bash build_sdcard.sh -f true -b dev -d headless -t false -w off
    # Options:
    #   -h, --help                               this help info
    #   -i, --interaction [0|1]                  interaction before proceeding with exection (default: 1)
    #   -f, --fatpack [0|1]                      fatpack mode (default: 1)
    #   -u, --github-user [rootzoll|other]       github user to be checked from the repo (default: rootzoll)
    #   -b, --branch [v1.7|v1.8]                 branch to be built on (default: v1.7)
    #   -d, --display [lcd|hdmi|headless]        display class (default: lcd)
    #   -t, --tweak-boot-drive [0|1]             tweak boot drives (default: 1)
    #   -w, --wifi-region [off|US|GB|other]      wifi iso code (default: US) or 'off'
    ```

* Switch off when ready
* Attach an other disk (can be even small if you prune or [stop bitcoind](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/issues/1500#issuecomment-982779830) manually.
The second virtual disk will be used as the BLOCKCHAIN drive.
This makes that data portable and independent from the OS similar to the combination of the SDcard and separate SSD.

### Notes

#### Data drive
* create a raw image of 500+ GB for best compatibility
* if there are permission issues try to symlink the disk image to `/var/lib/libvirt/images`

## Armbian
Many SBC-s are supported:
https://www.armbian.com/download/

To verify the downloaded image follow: https://docs.armbian.com/User-Guide_Getting-Started/#how-to-check-download-authenticity

Tested on:
* Odroid XU4 / HC1 / HC2 with the Armbian Buster image from https://www.armbian.com/odroid-xu4/

Burn the image to the SDcard with [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

Assemble and boot.

`ssh root@192.168.x.x`

password: `1234`

Follow the instructions in the terminal. Set the new password to `raspiblitz` and name the new user `admin` to keep in line with the rest of the setup.

Continue with building the SDcard: https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz#build-the-sd-card-image

---

## Ubuntu
A common distro to be supplied by the manufacturer for various boards.

Tested on:
* Odroid XU4 with ubuntu-18.04.1-4.14-minimal image from https://de.eu.odroid.in/ubuntu_18.04lts/XU3_XU4_MC1_HC1_HC2
* Nvidia Jetson Nano with Ubuntu Bionic image from https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit#write

Burn the image to the SDCard with [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

Assemble and boot.

`ssh root@192.168.x.x`

password: odroid

`apt-get update`

`apt-get upgrade`

if there is an error:
>E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)

>E: Unable to acquire the dpkg frontend lock (/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend), is another process using it?

run:
`reboot` and update as above

Continue with building the SDcard: https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz#build-the-sd-card-image

---

## Python upgrade
* run the commands below in the terminal line-by-line
  ```bash
  # select version
  pythonVersion="3.10.4"
  majorPythonVersion=$(echo "$pythonVersion" | awk -F. '{print $1"."$2}' )
  # update and upgrade
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade -y
  # dependencies
  sudo apt install wget software-properties-common build-essential libnss3-dev zlib1g-dev libgdbm-dev libncurses5-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev libbz2-dev -y
  # download
  wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/${pythonVersion}/Python-${pythonVersion}.tgz
  # optional signature for verification
  wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/${pythonVersion}/Python-${pythonVersion}.tgz.asc
  # get PGP pubkey of Pablo Galindo Salgado
  gpg --recv-key CFDCA245B1043CF2A5F97865FFE87404168BD847
  # check for: Good signature from "Pablo Galindo Salgado <pablogsal@gmail.com>"
  gpg --verify Python-${pythonVersion}.tgz.asc
  # unzip
  tar xvf Python-${pythonVersion}.tgz
  cd Python-${pythonVersion}
  # configure
  ./configure --enable-optimizations
  # install
  sudo make altinstall
  # move the python binary to the expected directory
  sudo mv $(which python${majorPythonVersion}) /usr/bin/
  # check
  ls -la /usr/bin/python${majorPythonVersion}
  ```

## Create an image release for amd64

Work notes partially based on: https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/blob/v1.7/FAQ.md#what-is-the-process-of-creating-a-new-sd-card-image-release

### Requirements:
* amd64 Laptop or Server connected to the internet via a LAN cable
* [`Ubuntu Live`](https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/ubuntu-20.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso) USB Stick to start on a clean system
* `Installation medium`: min 8GB SDcard / USB stick to install the base image from
* `OS disk`: min 32 GB Endurance type SDcard or USB SSD to run the operating system on
* (`Data disk`: a new, minimum 1TB SSD is recommended - not needed to create the image release)
* [`Tails USB Stick`](https://tails.boum.org/install/download/) to sign the image offline
* PGP keys on an USB stick to sign the image
* NTFS formatted USB Stick or disk to store the signed image (can reuse the Installation medium)

### Create an NTFS formatted USB Stick / USB disk
* can be prepared any time on a separate computer and can reuse the Installation medium

### Boot Ubuntu Live from USB
* Start [`Ubuntu Live`](https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/ubuntu-20.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso) from USB stick
* Under Settings: best to set correct keyboard language & power settings to prevent monitor turn off

### Download and verify the base image
* Download the latest [Debian Desktop netinst.io, SHA512SUMS and Signature](https://www.debian.org/download) and verify the [downloaded image](https://www.debian.org/CD/verify)
* In a terminal can use the following commands (see the comments for the explanations and an example output)
    ```bash
    # Download the base image:
    wget https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-11.3.0-amd64-netinst.iso
    # Download the SHA512SUMS:
    wget https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/SHA512SUMS
    # Download the Signature:
    wget https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/SHA512SUMS.sign

    # Verify:
    # download the signing pubkey:
    gpg --keyserver keyring.debian.org --receive-key DF9B9C49EAA9298432589D76DA87E80D6294BE9B
    # gpg: key DA87E80D6294BE9B: public key "Debian CD signing key <debian-cd@lists.debian.org>" imported
    # gpg: Total number processed: 1
    # gpg:               imported: 1
    # Verify the signature of the SHA512SUMS file
    gpg --verify gpg --verify SHA512SUMS.sign
    # Look for the output 'Good signature':
    # gpg: assuming signed data in 'SHA512SUMS'
    # gpg: Signature made Sat 26 Mar 2022 21:22:41 GMT
    # gpg:                using RSA key DF9B9C49EAA9298432589D76DA87E80D6294BE9B
    # gpg: Good signature from "Debian CD signing key <debian-cd@lists.debian.org>" [unknown]
    # gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
    # gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
    # Primary key fingerprint: DF9B 9C49 EAA9 2984 3258  9D76 DA87 E80D 6294 BE9B

    # Compare the hash to the hash of the image file:
    sha512sum -c SHA512SUMS --ignore-missing
    # Look for the output 'OK':
    # debian-11.3.0-amd64-netinst.iso: OK
    ```
### Flash the base image to the installation medium
* Connect an SDcard reader with a min 8GB SDcard or an USB stick.
* In the file manager open the context menu (right click) on the `netinst.iso` file.
* Select the option `Open With Other Application` and choose `Open With Disk Image Writer`.
* Write the image to the SDcard / USB SSD (Installation medium).
* Shut down the Laptop now and remove the `Ubuntu Live` USB Stick.

### Install Debian to the OS disk
* Connect the Laptop / Server to the LAN (with cable) with only the OS disk connected (no Data disk)
* Insert the installation medium to the USB and power up - boot from USB.
* Continue to work on the screen of the laptop or a connected monitor
* Install Debian with the defaults:
    * leave the root oassword empty (root user disabled)
    * create a new user called `pi`, set the password to `raspiblitz`
    * use a single partition for the OS
      * Choose: `Guided - use entire disk`
      * Select the OS disk
      * All files in one partition
      * Can remove the `Swap` partition - a swap file will be created on the Data disk later
* At the `Software selection` choose:
    * Debian dekstop environment
    * GNOME (could be other as preferred)
    * SSH server
    * standard system utilities
* Install GRUB on the primary partition (OS Disk)


### Install the RaspiBlitz Scripts
* Once the setup is finished reboot and log in with the `pi` user (pw: `raspiblitz`)
* Run the following commands to build from the `dev` branch or change `dev` with the branch name of your version:
    ```bash
    # download
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/dev/build_sdcard.sh
    # run
    sudo bash build_sdcard.sh -f true -b dev -d headless -t false -w off
    ```
* The `[sudo] password for pi:` is `raspiblitz`
* Confirm the chosen parameters
* Monitor/Check outputs for warnings/errors
* (Optional for development - copy the output to a build_sdcard.sh.log)

* Useful settings:
  * In Settings - Power - Automatic Suspend - Plugged In - Off
  * In Tweaks - General - Suspend when laptop lid is closed - Off


### Prepare the release
#### Clean and shutdown the build machine
* run the command (same as running `release` under `admin`):
    ```bash
    sudo -u admin /home/admin/config.scripts/blitz.preparerelease.sh
    ```
* This will shut down the laptop.
* Remove the `Installation medium` and the `Ubuntu Live` USB stick and the LAN cable
#### Start Tails
* Connect the `Tails USB Stick` (make it stay offline)
* Boot Tails and set and Admin password in Additioanl Settings (will need it to work with the disk)
* Set the screen to not switch off: Settings > Power -> Blank screen - Never
#### Import the signing keys
* Connect USB stick with GPG signing keys - decrypt drive if needed
* Open Terminal and cd into directory of USB Stick under `/media/amnesia`
* Run `gpg --import ./secret-key-backup.key`, check and `exit`
* Disconnect USB stick with GPG keys
##### Prepare the disk
* Start Disks and resize the OS disk partition to 10GB
* Connect the NTFS USB stick, open in file manager and delete old files
* Open a terminal from the NTFS disk with right click
* Run `lsblk` in a terminal to double check the OS disk device name (ignore last partition number)
* Clone and compress the OS disk image (copy 11GB so the 10GB sized partition is comfortably included):
    ```bash
    sudo dd if=/dev/[OSdiskddevice] bs=1G count=11 status=progress | gzip > raspiblitz-amd64-vX.X.X-YEAR-MONTH-DAY.img.gz
    ```
* When finished you should see that 30GB was copied (the resulting compressed file is less than 3GB).
* Create sha256 hash of the image:
    ```bash
    sha256sum *.gz > raspiblitz-amd64-vX.X.X-YEAR-MONTH-DAY.img.gz.sha256
    ```
* Sign the sha256 hash file:
    ```bash
    gpg --detach-sign --armor *.sha256
    ```
* Check the files:
  ```bash
  ls
    raspiblitz-amd64-vX.X.X-YEAR-MONTH-DAY.img.gz
    raspiblitz-amd64-vX.X.X-YEAR-MONTH-DAY.img.gz.sha256
    raspiblitz-amd64-vX.X.X-YEAR-MONTH-DAY.img.gz.sha256.asc
  ```

* Test with:
    ```bash
    gpg --verify *.asc
    shasum -c *.sha256
    ```

* Shutdown the build computer
* Upload the new image to server - put the .sig file and .sha256 next to it
* Copy the sha256sum to GitHub README and update the download link

## Verify the downloaded image
### Linux instructions
* Open a terminal in the directory with the downloaded files
    ```
    raspiblitz-amd64-vX.X.X-YEAR-MONTH-DAY.img.gz
    raspiblitz-amd64-vX.X.X-YEAR-MONTH-DAY.img.gz.sha256
    raspiblitz-amd64-vX.X.X-YEAR-MONTH-DAY.img.gz.sha256.asc
    ```
* Paste the following commands (see the comments for the explanations and an example output)
  ```bash
  # Import the signing pubkey:
  curl https://keybase.io/oms/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import

  # Verify the signature of the sha256 hash:
