# Shopping List: Australia

*__NOTICE: This shopping list still needs testing of listed components__ - [please report](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/issues/691) if you have bad experiences or ideas for better cheaper updates.*

The new shopping list comes in three different packages: Minimal, Standard & Maximal:

## Package: Standard (around 320 AUD)

*The "Standard Package" is most tested and recommended if you can effort it. It aims to give you the best economic value to run all the RaspiBlitz features at a good performance and even allows you to self-validate your blockchain in under 3 days.* 

* RaspBerry Pi 4 2GB: [core-electronics.com.au](https://core-electronics.com.au/raspberry-pi-4-model-b-2gb.html)
* Power USB C: [core-electronics.com.au](https://core-electronics.com.au/raspberry-pi-power-supply-usb-c-5v-15w-white.html) 
* ShimFan Cooling: [core-electronics.com.au](https://core-electronics.com.au/pimoroni-fan-shim-for-raspberry-pi.html)
* 500GB SSD: [amazon.com.au](https://www.amazon.com.au/Crucial-2-5-inch-Adapter-Internal-CT500MX500SSD1/dp/B0786QNS9B)
* SSD-Case: [amazon.com.au](https://www.amazon.com.au/UGREEN-Enclosure-External-Adapter-Housing/dp/B07L4LYVC6)
* Micro SD-Card 32GB: [amazon.com.au](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07B98GXQT)
* LCD-Display: [amazon.com.au](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07L42Z79L)
* RaspberryPi-Case: [core-electronics.com.au](https://core-electronics.com.au/pimoroni-pibow-coupe-4-ninja-raspberry-pi-4-only.html)

## Package: Minimal (around 300 AUD)

*The minimal package aims for the cheapest price and allows you to use old hardware. It will always be possible to run all the basic features of a Bitcoin- & Lightning-Fullnode, but the system might be too slow to validate the blockchain history by itself and run some resource intensive extended services.*

Basic Parts for all minimal variants:
* 1TB Hard Drive: [amazon.com.au](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B079D359S6)
* Micro SD-Card 16GB: [amazon.com.au](https://www.amazon.com.au/Sandisk-Ultra-Micro-UHS-I-Adapter/dp/B073K14CVB)
* LCD-Display: [amazon.com.au](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07L42Z79L)

If you have already a used RaspberryPi 3 B+ you can reuse with the following parts:
* RaspBerry Pi 3: [amazon.com.au](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07BFR7PBS)
* Power >=3A: [core-electronics.com.au](https://core-electronics.com.au/raspberry-pi-3-power-supply.html) 
* Heatsink-Case: [amazon.com.au](https://www.amazon.com.au/Raspberry-Aluminum-Dissipation-Enclosure-Heatsink/dp/B07M8SH8TM)

Or if you order new go with the RaspberryPi 4 and the following parts:
* RaspBerry Pi 4 1GB: [core-electronics.com.au](https://core-electronics.com.au/raspberry-pi-4-model-b-1gb.html)
* Power USB C: [core-electronics.com.au](https://core-electronics.com.au/raspberry-pi-power-supply-usb-c-5v-15w-white.html) 
* ShimFan Cooling: [core-electronics.com.au](https://core-electronics.com.au/pimoroni-fan-shim-for-raspberry-pi.html)
* RaspberryPi-Case: [core-electronics.com.au](https://core-electronics.com.au/pimoroni-pibow-coupe-4-ninja-raspberry-pi-4-only.html)

## Package: Maximal

*The maximal package is still in the works ... if you want to prepare for it, take the standard package as a base and choose the RaspberryPi4 with 4GB and a high quality 1TB SSD instead of 500GB.*
