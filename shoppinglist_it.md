# Shopping List: Italy

*__NOTICE: This shopping list had just basic testing of components__ - [please report](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/issues/691) if you have bad experiences or ideas for better cheaper updates.*

The new shopping list comes in three different packages: Minimal, Standard & Maximal:

## Package: Standard (around 200 EUR)

*The "Standard Package" is most tested and recommended if you can effort it. It aims to give you the best economic value to run all the RaspiBlitz features at a good performance and even allows you to self-validate your blockchain in under 3 days.* 

* RaspBerry Pi 4 2GB: [pimoroni.com](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-4?variant=29157087412307)
* ShimFan Cooling: [pimoroni.com](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/fan-shim) (order later if sold out)
* Power USBC: [pimoroni.com](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-official-usb-c-power-supply-eu?variant=29392393371750) or [pimoroni.com](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/universal-usb-c-power-supply-5-1v-3a)
* RaspberryPi-Case: [pimoroni.com](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pibow-coupe-4?variant=29210100105299)
* 500GB SSD: [amazon.it](https://www.amazon.it/Crucial-MX500-CT500MX500SSD1-Interno-Pollici/dp/B0784SLQM6)
* SSD-Case: [amazon.it](https://www.amazon.it/UGREEN-Esterno-Toshiba-Seagate-Samsung/dp/B07D2BHVBD)
* Micro SD-Card 32GB: [amazon.it](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B07CY3QSST)
* LCD-Display: [amazon.it](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B06ZZBL1C4)

## Package: Minimal (around 150 EUR)

*The minimal package aims for the cheapest price and allows you to use old hardware. It will always be possible to run all the basic features of a Bitcoin- & Lightning-Fullnode, but the system might be too slow to validate the blockchain history by itself and run some resource intensive extended services.*

Basic Parts for all minimal variants:
* 1TB Hard Drive: [amazon.it](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B07997KKSK)
* Micro SD-Card 16GB: [amazon.it](https://www.amazon.it/Samsung-MB-MC32GA-EU-MicroSD-Adattatore/dp/B06XFSZGCC)
* LCD-Display: [amazon.it](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B06ZZBL1C4)

If you have already a used RaspberryPi 3 B+ you can reuse with the following parts:
* RaspBerry Pi 3: [amazon.it](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B07BDR5PDW/)
* Power >=3A: [amazon.it](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B01JZE38QE)
* Heatsink-Case: [amazon.it](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B07KYCNF1D)

Or if you order new go with the RaspberryPi 4 1GB and the following parts:
* RaspBerry Pi 4 1GB: [pimoroni.com](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-4?variant=29157087379539)
* ShimFan Cooling: [pimoroni.com](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/fan-shim) (order later if sold out)
* Power USBC: [pimoroni.com](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-official-usb-c-power-supply-eu?variant=29392393371750) or [pimoroni.com](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/universal-usb-c-power-supply-5-1v-3a)
* RaspberryPi-Case: [pimoroni.com](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pibow-coupe-4?variant=29210100105299)

## Package: Maximal

*The maximal package is still in the works ... if you want to prepare for it, take the standard package as a base and choose the RaspberryPi4 with 4GB and a high quality 1TB SSD instead of 500GB.*
