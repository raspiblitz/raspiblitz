  # PROVISION - reinstall on updates & recovery
  # Take a look at `_provision_.sh` script - you can see that there all bonus apps install scripts get called if
  # they have an active entry in the raspiblitz config. This is needed so that on sd card image update or recovery
  # all apps get installed again. So add your app there accordantly so its install will survive an sd card update.

  # MAINMENU - show users that app is installed
  # Take a look at the `00mainmenu.sh` script - you can see there almost all bonus apps add a menu entry there if
  # they are installed that then is calling this script with the `menu` parameter. Add your app accordingly.

  # SERVICES MENU - add your app for onclick install
  # Take a look at the `00settingsMenuServices.sh` script - you can there almost all bonus apps added themselves
  # as an option in to be easily installed & deinstalled. Add your app there accordantly.

  # DEBUGLOGS - add some status information
  # Take a look at the `blitz.debug.sh` script - you can see there that apps if they are installed give some
  # information on their latest logs and where to find them in the case that the user is searching for an  error.
  # So its best practice to also add your app there with some small info to help on debug & finding error logs.

  # PRESTART & DEINSTALL

# config parameters for this app can be updated so that it always starts with the most updated
# values. With such an "adhoc config" it is for example possible to check right before start
# what other apps are installed and configure connections. Even if those configs outdate later
# while the app is running with the next restart they will then automatically update their config
# again. If you dont need such "adhoc" config for your app - just leave it empty as it is, so
# you maybe later on have the option to use it.
