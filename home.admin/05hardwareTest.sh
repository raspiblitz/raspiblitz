Your power supply was FAILING the stress test (${powerMIN}).
Most reports of data loss are caused by weak power supplies.
Also a lot of RaspiBlitz setups fail because of weak power supplies.
To SHUTDOWN and upgrade the Power Supply is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

See upcomming screen on detailed info how to improve on power supply.

Your power supply seems OK - but could be better for stable operations.
A replacement/upgrade of the Power Supply is recommended if possible.
Because most reports of data loss are caused by weak power supplies.

Already during runtime of RaspiBlitz Undervoltage Reports were detected.
A upgrade of the Power Supply is strongly recommended (see next screen).

You should see the number of outages on your LCD as an ongoing counting.
Note that after replacement of power supply this number is not set to 0. 
As long that counting is not going further up you are good.

    whiptail --backtitle "RaspiBlitz v${codeVersion}" --title " What todo on Power Issues " --msgbox "
To improve on power issues an upgrade of the power supply is recommended.
Check if you have the latest power supply listed in your shopping list.
If you have that one, please report on GitHub that alternative is needed.

In general a good power supply needs to fullfill this three points:
- needs to deliver at least 3 Ampere
- needs to deliver a stable >=5V output (big & clunky is good)
- needs a thick cable (low AWG score) & best is no switch

If you think all is good with your power supply please also re-run test
up to 3 times. Sometimes a good power supply has 1 or 2 bad measurements.

Your RaspiBlitz is getting MUCH TOO HOT (${tempMAX}).

    whiptail --backtitle "RaspiBlitz v${codeVersion}" --title " What todo on Heat Issues " --msgbox "
To improve on heat issues an upgrade of the casing is recommended.
Check if you have the latest casing options in your shopping list.
Use a big passive heat sink or fan to prevent overheating.
If you have already one, check if its applied correctly to CPU.
In extreme cases consider some external fan helping out.

Again a RaspiBlitz getting hot can be tolerated. But it is
slowing down your CPU and may reduce the lifetime of hardware.
