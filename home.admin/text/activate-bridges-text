To circumvent sophisticated censorship, Tor introduced BRIDGES, which supports pluggable transports. These transports manipulate all Tor traffic between the client and its first hop such that it is not identifiable as a Tor connection.

IMPORTANT
- This menu entry activates OBFS4 bridges of Tor to bypass
  Tor blocking in a country. It helps to circumvent censorship; however,
  it doesn't help if a firewall blocks the network traffic.
- If OBFS4 bridges don't help, try MEEK-AZURE or SNOWFLAKE (see menu
  entries below).
- You should only activate OBFS4 bridges if necessary. It could lead
  to a less stable and slower data transfer speed. By default, the OBFS4
  BRIDGE MODE is deactivated.
