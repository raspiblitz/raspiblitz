# Shopping List: Canada

*__NOTICE: This shopping list still needs testing of listed components__ - [please report](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz/issues/691) if you have bad experiences or ideas for better cheaper updates.*

The new shopping list comes in three different packages: Minimal, Standard & Maximal:

## Package: Standard (around 250 USD)

*The "Standard Package" is most tested and recommended if you can effort it. It aims to give you the best economic value to run all the RaspiBlitz features at a good performance and even allows you to self-validate your blockchain in under 3 days.* 

* RaspBerry Pi 4 2GB + Power: [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Basic-Kit-2GB/dp/B07TYK4RL8) (shipping from USA)
* ShimFan Cooling: [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Pimoroni-Fan-Shim-Raspberry-PI/dp/B07TTTCN8H/) (shipping from USA)
* 500GB SSD: [amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/Crucial-MX500-500GB-NAND-Internal/dp/B0786QNS9B)
* SSD-Case: [amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/UGREEN-Enclosure-External-Adapter-Housing/dp/B07D2BHVBD)
* Micro SD-Card 32GB: [amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07DTFRNRJ)
* LCD-Display: [amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07L1215W5)
* RaspberryPi-Case: [thecryptocloak.com](https://thecryptocloak.com/product/lightningshell/) (SELECT Rpi4! - shipping from USA)

## Package: Minimal (around 180 USD)

*The minimal package aims for the cheapest price and allows you to use old hardware. It will always be possible to run all the basic features of a Bitcoin- & Lightning-Fullnode, but the system might be too slow to validate the blockchain history by itself and run some resource intensive extended services.*

Basic Parts for all minimal variants:
* 1TB Hard Drive: [amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B079D359S6)
* Micro SD-Card 16GB: [amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/Sandisk-Ultra-Micro-UHS-I-Adapter/dp/B073K14CVB)
* LCD-Display: [amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07L1215W5)

If you have already a used RaspberryPi 3 B+ you can reuse with the following parts:
* RaspBerry Pi 3: [amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07BFH96M3)
* Power >=3A: [amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07MC7B9X3) 
* Heatsink-Case: [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07M8SH8TM) (shipping from USA)

Or if you order new go with the RaspberryPi 4 2GB and the following parts:
* RaspBerry Pi 4 2GB + Power: [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Basic-Kit-2GB/dp/B07TYK4RL8) (shipping from USA)
* ShimFan Cooling: [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Pimoroni-Fan-Shim-Raspberry-PI/dp/B07TTTCN8H/) (shipping from USA)
* RaspberryPi-Case: (waiting for a cheap RP4 case from thecryptocloak.com - you can run without for now)

## Package: Maximal

*The maximal package is still in the works ... if you want to prepare for it, take the standard package as a base and choose the RaspberryPi4 with 4GB and a high quality 1TB SSD instead of 500GB.*
